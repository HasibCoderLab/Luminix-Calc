## 📌 Why the name "LuminixCalc"?

“Calculator” doesn’t just mean a tool for calculations — how it looks and how it **feels** also matter.  
`Luminix` combines “Light” and a techy futuristic vibe — so I chose this name to instantly give users the feeling that:  
**This isn’t just a calculator — this is LuminixCalc!**
